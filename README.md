# DSA Basics

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations in **C/C++**, built as part of my learning and interview preparation.  
Each topic is organized into folders with well-structured code for practice.

---

##  Folder Structure

- **Array** → Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching  
- **2D Array** → Basic 2D array construction  
- **Linked List**  
  - Singly Linked List (Creation, Insertion, Deletion, Reversal)  
  - Doubly Linked List  
  - Circular Linked List  
  - Doubly Circular Linked List  
- **Stack** → Implementation using Array and Linked List  
- **Queue** → Implementation using Array and Linked List  
- **Searching** → Linear Search, Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)  
- **Sorting** → Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge Sort  
- **Tree** → Binary Tree, Tree Traversals, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm
- **Graph** → BFS, DFS, MST Kruskal and Prim

## How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MishraNehal/DSA-Basics.git

2. Navigate to the folder of your choice:
   ```bash
    cd DSA-Basics/Array


3. Compile and run any program:
  ```bash
   gcc Insertion.c -o Insertion
  ./Insertion
